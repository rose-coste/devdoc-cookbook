                        Writers like to
                        write. Writers like to eat. 
                        Writers like to write about
                        things to eat.
                        Writers like to read about
                        things to eat. 
                        The easiest way to read more about things to eat 
                        is to write more about things to eat. 
                        It's all good.

                    <para> Probably not. We're <emphasis role="italic"
                            >technical</emphasis> writers. That means
                        we spend most of our time explaining things
                        that other people invented. We like
                        inventions. We like writing about inventions
                        almost as much as we like writing about things
                        to eat. We can't eat most of the inventions
                        that we write about, but we have eaten some of
                        these. </para>

                        Are these the only recipes the DevDoc

                        Hardly. 
                        We always
                        know much more than we tell. 
                        We like these recipes and we're happy to share them.
                        In a future release, especially 
                        after analyzing reader feedback and 
                        recruiting additional contributors,
                        we might share a larger subset of the
                        vast universe of our knowledge.

                    <para> Our style guide doesn't address recipe
                        formatting; we're conducting user experience
                        research A/B comparing multiple wireframe
                        designs, after which we'll draft, coordinate,
                        and implement a standard in a future release.
                        Or we're agile: we release what we have as
                        soon as it's usable, whether or not it's
                        beautiful; we'll get around to "beautiful"
                        later, after we find an executive sponsor for
                        an epic to pay down our technical debt. Or it
                        might be that we're lazy. </para>

                        We have very high standards for art about food. 
                        When we create or acquire some appropriately amazing illustrations, 
                        we'll add them to the

                        Let's just say that
                        some of us have tried some of the recipes, from our source
                        material but not from this document, so it's always
                        possible that something was lost in the transition to this
                        format. We mean well, but we don't have any QE resources.
                        You should make a small batch and taste it before trying
                        to impress your customers with anything you find in this
                        starter kit.
