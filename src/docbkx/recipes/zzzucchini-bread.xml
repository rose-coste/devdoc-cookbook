    <title>Zzzucchini bread</title>

    <note>
    <para><emphasis role="italic"> This recipe is from my mother's
                mother's sister, my great aunt Celia Zydowicz
                Ziemkiewicz. Aunt Celia lived a long and busy life in
                Cleveland, Ohio. Every October, maybe until she was 90
                and I was 40 years old, she came to San Antonio for
                ten days to visit us and to buy two pairs of shoes
                (one black pair for winter, one brown pair for summer)
                from San Antonio Shoemakers. Every time she came, she
                brought a suitcase full of her baking, including
                zzzucchini bread wrapped in waxed paper and aluminum
                foil. I must have been 20 years old before I figured
                out that zucchini was not a sweet fruit like an apple
                or a banana, and we actually had plenty in local
                grocery stores and didn't need to import it from
                Cleveland. I remember that Celia was quite annoyed at
                my impatience when I wanted her to tell me the recipe
                so I could try it myself instead of waiting for her
                annual visit. She wasn't one for written recipes,
                preferring to do what works rather than what's
                written, but she gave me this summary anyway.
